### Bad Data Visualization: 
A Supreme Court With Merrick Garland Would Be the Most Liberal in Decades

This data visualization is confusing and hard to read. Data visualizations should present data in a way that makes the data accessible and fairly intuitive. Though this graphic looks cool and is really comprehensive in terms of the data it includes, there is too much going on for it to be easily readable. The light gray dots, dark gray dots and different colored arrows pointing in different directions draw my eye all over the place rather than to a single focal point or overall trend. 

I am particularly confused by the light gray dots. I know that they represent the median of the term, but which justice does the median reflect? I think it's supposed to be a point of comparison for how liberal or conservative the court was leaning generally as compared to incoming or outgoing justices, but it's kind of difficult to figure out that comparison. The x axis, which is scaled in five year increments, makes it hard to figure out which years line up with which ideological shifts, but the Times might have just decided that the time period wasn't all that important and chosen to put less emphasis on it. (I guess people aren't necessarily using this visualization to figure out when Rehnquist came on as a justice and it does generally show which decade each justice shifted on and off.)

It seemed that the point The New York Times was trying to make was that Merrick Garland, or whoever is selected as Scalia's replacement (if selected while Obama is still president) could swing the balance of the court to a much more liberal position, but this isn't really reflected in the visualization. The blue arrow pointing from Scalia to the question mark on the far right side does not seem like an especially dramatic or noteworthy shift, especially considering the extremely long red arrows drawn near the middle of the graph that represent the shift from Douglas to Stevens and from Marshall to Thomas. 

In general, I'm not convinced that this data visualization really added anything to the article text. I think it could have been just as effective to write about the major shifts in ideology, or to do a simple flow chart.  

### Good Data Visualization:
How terrorism in the West compares to terrorism everywhere else

This data visualization is really powerful. It breaks down the terrorist attacks since the beginning of 2015 by geography (west versus east) and by month. The bar chart is very visual and easy to understand, though it does lack a y axis scale. I think the lack of a y axis is remedied by the Post’s decision to label some of the well-known attacks, like the Charlie Hebdo attack, the ISIS attacks on Paris and the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando. Each of these attacks is highlighted by a black bar instead of an orange one and is labeled with the number of deaths. 

Below the visual for 2015 terror attacks in Europe and the Americas is the visual for the Middle East, Africa and Asia. This is especially impactful as you scroll and see how much larger the bars on the graph are in this part of the visual. Again, some of the notorious and most deadly attacks are labeled with black indicators and the number of people killed in each attack. One concern I do have with this visualization, though, is that not all of the attacks where large numbers of people were killed are labeled, and none of the attacks in which a few people were killed are labeled at all. I would be curious to know how the data team decided which attacks to label and if they came up with a standard. I also wonder about the ethics of labeling some but not all of the attacks. 

I think the color choices are really effective--orange is a bright and eye-catching color without being offensive and black is bold and draws the eye. As a user, I also really appreciated being able to compare the total numbers killed in terrorist attacks in the middle of the visualization on either side of the name of each month. For me, this really drove home the point that the number of attacks and deaths in Europe and the Americas pales in comparison to the number of attacks in other parts of the world. It’s sobering information that’s well-presented.
