More than 10,600 affordable housing units have been completed or are set to be completed in the District, according to 2015 city government data. 

Ward 8 is the region with the greatest number of units in existence or in process--the data shows a count of 3,525 units, despite having the second-lowest population of the District's eight wards according to 2010 neighborhood data. Ward 8 has over 1,300 more affordable housing units than the next-highest on the list, ward 7, which has 2,205 units listed. The chart shows the total number of units listed for each ward.

The area with the fewest affordable housing units is ward 3 with a mere 51 units, despite it being the ward with the largest population. Neighborhood data from 2010 lists the population of ward 3 as 78,887. Please see the chart for a comparison of ward populations.

This suggests a possible socioeconomic status or income disparity between the wards, because one would expect a heavily populated and socioeconomically diverse neighborhood to have more than 51 available or in-process affordable housing units. Other factors may be affecting this number, so this story will develop as the research continues. 

The data divides the affordable housing units into three categories based on their "public status." The units are listed as either "completed 2015 to date," "under construction" or "pipeline." Pipeline is a vague term that developers use when they are working on a project but do not have a definitive project timetable. The data lists 5,014 units with the status "pipeline." Meanwhile 3,805 units are categorized as "under construction" and 1,854 units have been "completed 2015 to date." The chart shows a breakdown of these unit categorizations.
