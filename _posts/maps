For this week, I made a map on Carto that shows the locations of hospitals around the country. The map is also color-coded based on how many beds are at each hospital: the darker red dots represent the hospitals with more beds and the light yellow dots are hospitals with fewer beds. While this data is sort of a population map, because the hospitals with greater numbers of beds are generally located in larger cities, I think being able to see the precise locations of the hospitals is eye-opening.

This week I also had some technical difficulties.
